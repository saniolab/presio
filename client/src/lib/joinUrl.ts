// Join URLs (QR codes + copyable controller/viewer links) used to be built from
// window.location.origin, which breaks a local deployment: the presenter opens
// Presio at http://localhost:3001, a phone scans the QR, and resolves localhost
// to the phone itself.
//
// A browser can't discover its own LAN address — WebRTC ICE candidates are
// deliberately obfuscated to mDNS names — but the *server* is running on the
// machine we want the address of, so it can look it up directly
// (server/lib/lanAddress.ts). Resolution therefore goes, in order:
//
//   1. An address the presenter typed here before  — they know best.
//   2. GET /api/lan-address                        — the usual answer, no input.
//   3. window.location.origin                      — hosted deploys, unchanged.
//
// Whatever wins is then *verified* by fetching it (see probeOrigin), because
// there are common ways for a plausible address to be unusable: a host firewall
// dropping the port, or an address stored on a network the presenter has since
// left. Only when that check fails does the manual field appear — so in the
// normal case nobody is asked for an IP, and when someone is asked, it's
// because there is real evidence something is wrong.
//
// None of this runs on a hosted deployment: the whole path is gated on the page
// itself being loopback, which presio.xyz never is.
