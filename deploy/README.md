# Self-hosting Presio

The whole Presio stack runs from **one `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root**,
fronted by a small shared **Traefik** reverse proxy (in [`proxy/`](../proxy)) that
terminates TLS and routes your domains. The proxy is a separate, host-level
project so you can run other apps behind the same proxy later — see
[Adding more apps](#adding-more-apps-to-the-same-host).

| `presio`         | The app — Express + Socket.IO server that also serves the built React client (built by `deploy/Dockerfile`).                                                      |
| `kong` + `*`     | A pinned, self-hosted [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) stack — Postgres, GoTrue (auth), Storage, PostgREST, Kong gateway, Studio. |
| `minio`          | [MinIO](https://min.io) object store; Supabase Storage uses it as its S3 backend, so synced PDFs live here.                                                       |
| `presio-db-init` | One-shot job that applies the repo's `dbschema.sql` (the `sessions` table + `presentations` bucket) once auth and storage are ready.                              |

Only `presio` and `kong` are exposed (via Traefik labels + the `web` network);
everything else stays on the internal network. Almost no app code is
Supabase-specific — it's reached only via env-configured URLs/keys — so
self-hosting is mostly configuration.

                          # persistent data: ./data/{postgres,minio,storage,db-config}
                          # app image is pulled; Kong/Postgres init files come from it

  Dockerfile              # builds the presio app image (CI / GHCR)
  .env.example            # every stack setting; copy to ./.env and fill in
  volumes/                # vendored Supabase config, baked into the image
    UPSTREAM_PINNED_SHA.txt
dbschema.sql              # baked into the image; applied by presio-db-init
```

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host with Docker + Docker Compose, ports **80 and 443** open.
- Two DNS `A`/`AAAA` records pointing at the host, e.g. `presio.xyz` (app) and
  `supabase.presio.xyz` (Supabase API). They must resolve publicly for Let's
  Encrypt to issue certificates.

## 1. Generate secrets

The Supabase secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) must be a
matching set. Generate them with Supabase's helper:
<https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#generate-api-keys>
(or `sh utils/generate-keys.sh` from a checkout of `supabase/supabase`).

## 2. Configure the stack `.env`

Copy the example to a `.env` **at the repo root** (this is where
`docker compose` reads it from when you run it from the root):

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example .env
# edit .env — domains, the generated secrets, MinIO + dashboard passwords,
# and OAuth client credentials (GitHub and/or Authentik).
```

Set the domains to your **real, externally-resolvable** values:

- `APP_HOST` / `SUPABASE_HOST` → bare hostnames, e.g. `presio.xyz` /
  `supabase.presio.xyz` (these drive Traefik's `Host()` routing rules).
- `SITE_URL` → `https://presio.xyz`
- `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` / `API_EXTERNAL_URL` → `https://supabase.presio.xyz`

> **Why the public URL matters:** the Presio server uses `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`
> both to call Supabase and to build the public PDF URLs it hands to viewers, so
> it has to be reachable from outside the stack.

## 3. OAuth / SSO

Every provider uses the same callback:

- **Authorization callback URL:** `https://supabase.presio.xyz/auth/v1/callback`
  (i.e. `${API_EXTERNAL_URL}/auth/v1/callback`).

### GitHub

Create a GitHub OAuth App (Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps) with
that callback. Put its client id/secret into `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` /
`GITHUB_SECRET` in `.env`. Set `GITHUB_ENABLED=false` to disable it in GoTrue.
The login button follows `VITE_AUTH_GITHUB` (defaults to `GITHUB_ENABLED`).
Recreate `presio` after changing it (`docker compose up -d`).

### Authentik

Create an **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** in Authentik (confidential client) with
that same callback (`…/auth/v1/callback`, not `…/callback`), then an
Application bound to it. Scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`.

- `AUTHENTIK_ENABLED=true`
- `AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID` / `AUTHENTIK_SECRET` — from the Authentik provider
- `AUTHENTIK_URL` — the **issuer** from Authentik’s OpenID Configuration
  (the OpenID Configuration URL *without* `/.well-known/openid-configuration`),
  e.g. `https://authentik.example.com/application/o/presio/`

GoTrue has no dedicated Authentik provider. This stack registers it as a
**custom OIDC** provider (`custom:authentik`) via `authentik-provider-init`.
Do not use the Keycloak slot — it requests `/protocol/openid-connect/auth`,
which Authentik does not serve (you get Authentik’s “Not Found” page).

After changing these values, recreate `auth`, `authentik-provider-init`, and
`presio` (`docker compose up -d`).

Set `VITE_BRANDING=false` to hide marketing chrome (homepage pitch, “Enjoying
Presio?” newsletter, install prompt, wordmark). The drop zone, join code, and
recents stay. Recreate `presio` after changing it.

Set `VITE_END_DELETES=false` so **End Presentation** (and recents Close) only
stops the live session: viewers are disconnected, the PDF and recents entry
stay. Default is to delete. Recreate `presio` after changing it — compose also
passes the same value as `PRESIO_END_DELETES` so the API cannot destroy the
deck either.

Email/password is enabled too (`ENABLE_EMAIL_SIGNUP=true`). Set
`ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM=false` and fill `SMTP_*` for real verification
emails.

## 4. Start the shared proxy (once per host)

```bash
docker network create web        # the shared ingress network
cd proxy
cp .env.example .env             # set ACME_EMAIL
docker compose up -d
```

Traefik now owns ports 80/443 and watches Docker for labelled containers. You
only do this once — every app (including Presio) attaches to the `web` network.

## 5. Start Presio

Copy `docker-compose.yml` and a filled-in `.env` onto the host (no git
checkout). Persistent data is `./data` next to the compose file.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps                # everything healthy / completed
```

The Presio app image is pulled (`PRESIO_IMAGE`, default
`ghcr.io/saniolab/presio-local:main`). Changing `.env` (Supabase URL, anon
key, OAuth buttons, branding) only needs a container recreate, not an image
rebuild. To pick up a new image: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

First boot runs the Supabase migrations, creates the MinIO bucket, then
`presio-db-init` applies `dbschema.sql`, then `presio` starts. As soon as DNS
resolves, Traefik fetches certificates and serves:

- `https://presio.xyz` → the app
- `https://supabase.presio.xyz` → Supabase API + Studio (login
  `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` / `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`)

Watch certificate issuance / routing with `docker compose -p proxy logs -f traefik`.

## What sits in front of the app (production)

Two hops, and the count matters — it is what `trust proxy` is set to:

```
visitor ──▶ Cloudflare edge ──▶ Traefik ──▶ presio:3001
                                └── app.set("trust proxy", 1) counts from here
```

Traefik runs without `forwardedHeaders.trustedIPs`, so it **overwrites**
`X-Forwarded-For` with its own peer rather than appending to Cloudflare's. The
app therefore sees the Cloudflare edge as `req.ip`, and raising the hop count
would not change that — the visitor's real address survives only in
`Cf-Connecting-Ip`. `trust proxy` is kept for `req.protocol`, which `baseUrl()`
needs so generated links come out `https://`.

Both Traefik entrypoints refuse any source outside Cloudflare's published
ranges (`proxy/certs/dynamic/cfonly.yml`, applied as an entrypoint-default
middleware so every router is covered), and the host firewall is configured to
the same effect. That is what makes `Cf-Connecting-Ip` trustworthy at the edge:
it is an ordinary header, so it is only meaningful while the edge is
unavoidable.

## Rate limiting

The app does **no HTTP rate limiting of its own** — that belongs on whatever
proxy or CDN fronts it, which is the only layer that can see the real client
address. Behind two hops (a CDN, then Traefik) the address the app observes is
the CDN's edge, so a limiter here would put every visitor behind a given edge
into one shared bucket; the real address arrives only in a vendor header such
as `Cf-Connecting-Ip`, which is forgeable by anyone able to reach the origin
directly. presio.xyz limits at the Cloudflare edge and refuses non-Cloudflare
traffic at the origin. If you self-host without a CDN in front, add a limit on
your own proxy — Traefik's own `ratelimit` middleware is enough.

Independent of this, `join_session` over Socket.IO is throttled per connection
in `server/socket.ts`, because its reply reveals whether a 6-character join code
exists. That throttle is part of the app and needs no configuration.

## Versions and upgrading

Releases are `v*` git tags, published as container tags on
`ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local`:

| Tag | Moves when | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:1` | any 1.x release | **Production.** Fixes and features, no breaking changes. |
| `:1.2` | any 1.2.x patch | Production, if you'd rather adopt minor releases deliberately. |
| `:1.2.3` | never | Reproducible deploys; you upgrade by editing the tag. |
| `:latest` | any release | Trying it out; the newest release regardless of major. |
| `:main` | every merge to `main` | Testing unreleased work. **Not for production** — no upgrade guarantees. |
| `:sha-<short>` | never | Pinning one exact build. |

Every published image carries a signed build provenance attestation and an
SBOM. Verify a build really came from this repository with:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local:1 \
  --format '{{ json .Provenance }}'   # how and from what commit it was built
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local:1 \
  --format '{{ json .SBOM }}'         # what is inside it

# Releases from v1.2.0 onward also carry a Sigstore-signed attestation in
# GitHub's own store, which the CLI checks against this repository:
gh attestation verify --repo benedict-armstrong/presio \
  oci://ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local:1
```

### Upgrading

Data migrates **forward only**. Local mode's SQLite schema is versioned
(`PRAGMA user_version`, see `server/local/db.ts`) and the container applies any
outstanding migrations on start, copying the database to
`presio.db.bak-v<n>` in the data directory first. Starting an **older** image
against a newer data directory is refused rather than attempted, so roll
forward, don't roll back.

```bash
docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yml logs presio | grep '\[local\]'
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/healthz     # {"status":"ok", ..., "version":"1.2.3"}
```

Each release is tested for exactly this: CI boots the current release against a
data volume, writes a session, then boots the new build on the same volume and
reads it back.

### Backups

Everything local mode owns lives under `LOCAL_DATA_DIR` — the SQLite database
and the uploaded PDFs. One volume is the whole backup:

```bash
docker run --rm -v presio-data:/data -v "$PWD:/backup" alpine \
  tar czf /backup/presio-data.tgz -C /data .
```

Restore by stopping the container and untarring back into the volume. For the
full self-hosted stack, persistent state is `./data` next to
`docker-compose.yml` (Postgres, MinIO, storage, db-config):

```bash
tar czf presio-data.tgz -C ./data .
```

The `presio` container itself is stateless.

### Reporting a problem

Include the output of `/healthz` (it reports the running version) and, for
local mode, the `[local]` lines from the container log.

## Adding more apps to the same host

You do **not** add a second proxy. Give the new app's container a route on the
same proxy:

1. Attach its service to the external `web` network.
2. Add Traefik labels (swap the names/host/port):

   ```yaml
   networks: [default, web]
   labels:
     - "traefik.enable=true"
     - "traefik.docker.network=web"
     - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule=Host(`app2.example.com`)"
     - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.entrypoints=websecure"
     - "traefik.http.routers.myapp.tls=true"
     - "traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
   ```

3. Point `app2.example.com` at the host and `docker compose up -d`. TLS is
   served from the proxy's default certificate (a Cloudflare Origin CA cert
   covering `presio.xyz` + `*.presio.xyz`), so keep the hostname one level
   deep under `presio.xyz` — that's what Cloudflare's edge certificate and
   the origin cert both cover. No per-host ACME involved: the host firewall
   only admits Cloudflare on 80/443, so Let's Encrypt validation can't reach
   the origin anyway.

## Continuous deployment (optional)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs build/typecheck/compose-validate checks on every
push. There's no push-button deploy anymore (we dropped the Coolify API hook); to
auto-deploy on the host, add a step that SSHes in and runs
`git pull && docker compose up -d --build`, or use a tool like
[watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) / a webhook on the host.

## Updating the pinned Supabase version

The vendored files come from the `supabase/supabase` commit recorded in
`deploy/volumes/UPSTREAM_PINNED_SHA.txt`. To bump: re-fetch
`docker/docker-compose.yml`, `docker/docker-compose.s3.yml`, and
`docker/volumes/**` at the new commit, then re-apply the local adaptations (S3
backend on `storage`; the `minio` / `minio-createbucket` / `presio-db-init` /
`presio` services; the Traefik labels + `web` network on `presio`/`kong`; and the
uncommented GitHub provider lines in `auth`).

## Trimming unused services

Presio itself only needs `db`, `kong`, `auth`, `rest`, `storage`, `imgproxy`,
plus `minio`. `realtime`, `functions` (edge), and `supavisor` (pooler) are not
used (Presio runs its own Socket.IO and talks to Kong, not Postgres directly).
They're kept so the upstream stack boots exactly as shipped; you can disable them
to save resources, but leave `studio`/`meta` (Kong's health gate depends on
`studio`).

## Running fully local / offline

If you just want to present PDFs on your own machine or LAN — no public
domain, no accounts, no analytics — none of the above is needed at all. A
**single prebuilt container** (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`), no Supabase,
no `.env`, no checkout:

```bash
docker run -d --name presio -p 3001:3001 \
  -e PRESIO_MODE=local -e LOCAL_DATA_DIR=/data -e TRUST_PROXY=false \
  -v presio-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local:1
open http://localhost:3001
```

Or with Compose, which sets all of that for you:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benedict-armstrong/presio/main/local.docker-compose.yml
docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The image is published by `.github/workflows/publish-local-image.yml`; see
[Versions and upgrading](#versions-and-upgrading) for which tag to run. From a
checkout, `docker compose -f local.docker-compose.yml build` builds the same
image from source instead.

Set `PRESIO_MODE=local` and the server swaps Supabase for a bundled SQLite
database and filesystem storage under `/data` (see `server/local/`) instead of
Postgres/GoTrue/Storage/Kong. Login and cross-device sync-by-account aren't
available in this mode (there's no auth provider to back them), but everything
else works: local presentations, handoff links, and controller/viewer sync
over Socket.IO. CORS accepts any origin in this mode since there's no fixed
domain to allow ahead of time, and PDF links are relative, so they resolve
correctly whichever address the page was opened at.

### Joining from other devices

Viewers on the same network join by scanning the QR code on the share screen.
Presio works out this machine's LAN address itself, so on a local install
there's usually nothing to configure — but it can only do that when it can see
the host's network, and a container on Docker's default bridge network can't:
every address it can see belongs to the container. In that case set
`PRESIO_PUBLIC_HOST` to the address other devices reach this machine on, read
at run time so it needs no rebuild:

```bash
docker run -d --name presio -p 3001:3001 \
  -e PRESIO_MODE=local -e LOCAL_DATA_DIR=/data -e TRUST_PROXY=false \
  -e PRESIO_PUBLIC_HOST=192.168.1.20:3001 \
  -v presio-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/benedict-armstrong/presio-local:1
```

On Linux, `--network host` works instead and needs no address at all — but not
on Docker Desktop, where the "host" is a Linux VM rather than your machine.
Without either, the share screen asks for the address once and remembers it.

To find the address, run this **on the host machine**, not inside the
container — it's the one on the network your phone or laptop is on, usually
starting `192.168.`, `10.` or `172.`:

| OS | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (Wi-Fi; try `en1` if that's empty), or System Settings › Network |
| Windows | `ipconfig`, then the `IPv4 Address` of the connected adapter |
| Linux | `hostname -I` (the first address), or `ip route get 1.1.1.1` and read `src` |

Append the port Presio is served on (`3001` above). Opening
`http://<that-address>:3001` on the other device directly works too. If it
doesn't connect, check that both devices are on the same network — guest Wi-Fi
and client isolation block it regardless of the address — and that the host
firewall allows the port.
